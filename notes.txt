Virtual Env : a setup in which we can use different versions of the same application to work on different projects and use different features.
Installed virtual env through :  python3 -m venv <name>

Helps you isolate your project dependencies

To activate your Venv : source <name>/bin/activate
To deactivate : deactivate

Install FastAPI: pip install FastAPI

Note: When pushing your code into remote repo's, we dont need to track/store venv file in the repo. To avoid this we will .gitignore file.
Instead use requirements.txt file to track all your dependencies/packages in the project. Use this file to install dependencies.

To create a requirements.txt file: pip freeze > requirements.txt 
To install packages/dependencies from requirements.txt file we use : pip install -r requirements.txt 

Note: How to use .gitignore ( create manually - a file named .gitignore in the root ) 
gitignore is a file that contains a list of file names or folders that we want to avoid in our git repo.

To creat a FastAPI  project repo: 
Go to github and manually create a public repo
follow all the commands and push the code.
Whenever you make changes, save the file and follow below cmd: 
git add . - adds all the files from the project to the local staging.
git commit -m "message" -  commits the code
git push -u origin main - pushes the code
